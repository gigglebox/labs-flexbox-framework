# Labs: Flexbox Framework

> [Demo Link - http://giggleboxstudios.net/labs/flexbox-framework/](http://giggleboxstudios.net/labs/flexbox-framework/)

This is a basic implementation of a UI framework leveraging the benefits of flexbox. According to [html5please.com](http://html5please.com/#flexbox) flexbox is good-to-go! So why not use it? ;D

This system was built with the help of Chris Coyier's ["Complete Guide to Flexbox"](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) on css-tricks.com
